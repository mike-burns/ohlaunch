Store a SQLite table of resolve_infos:

  position     INT
  visible      BOOLEAN
  package_name TEXT    # resolveInfo.activityInfo.applicationInfo.packageName
  name         TEXT    # resolveInfo.activityInfo.name
  label        TEXT    # resolveInfo.loadLabel(packageManager)
  icon         INT     # resolveInfo.getIconResource

The initial table is alphabetical. A BroadcastReceiver listens for app changes;
new apps are pushed onto the end, deleted apps update all `position' fields.

onCreateView, show the contents of the table ordered by position where visible,
then kick off a task to load the icons.

Long-press an app to hide it. Add a menu option to show hidden apps and change
visibility.

Add menu option to show list of apps: select one, then select where in the list
you'd like the app to appear above. Add blank spot at end of the list so the
app can appear above it.


-

Menu with "About" option.

Don't hardcode 88.

I can probably charge for these:

Figure out rotation.

-

Dots to indicate which page you're on.

-

Gesture-based pagination: swipe to top left = first page; bottom left = second
page; etc.

-

Additional page at end for widgets. One page.
